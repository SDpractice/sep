**Scot Export Event**
- Nov 12 at Technology Innovation Centre

**Audience**
- Circa 800 Exporters or people looking to export

**We were focusing on**
- Testing Feedback emails (ratings and surveys)
- Testing options to improve the jump from our site to external events providers sites (usually partners)
- Researching assisted digital experiences and preferences

**What we discovered (so far)**
- People preferred the text "This link opens a different website in a new tab" over "This link opens in a new tab"
- People prefer the text ABOVE the link button
