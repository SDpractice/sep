**Summary of insights**

### Enquiries Portal
- All 4 partners found the prototype to be simple and straightforward
  - Looks simple to use
  - Looks very straight-forward
  - It looks nice and simple, I would make sure to keep it that way. No need to complicate it

- Partners would like some sort of notification when a new enquiry is received, this could be via a simple email to their inbox
- The open enquiry page was easy to understand and partners were happy to see the search and sort options. One of them felt that having an enquiry type option would help them better understand multiple requests from a company.
- The Actions button at the top was confusing to all, two felt that it was an action to fulfil an enquiry. But having clicked on the button to see “export as csv” was a good to have option.
- The enquiry detail screen was also simple and easy to understand and it was comprehensive.
- All felt that some sort of notes section while fulfilling the enquiry will be a useful thing to have as then they could see what has happened with the enquiry and who dealt with it.
- All partners were of the opinion that it would be really useful if they could fulfil the enquiry from within the system otherwise their current processes are sufficient and having an enquiry portal is pointless.
- If an enquiry was wrongly assigned to an org, they would like to send it back to the FBS central team back from within the portal by having a “send back to sender” option or something similar
