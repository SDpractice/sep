We recently developed new key messages for FBS to help better explain the site's vision and purpose. We then updated the [About Us page](https://findbusinesssupport.gov.scot/about-us) to reflect these new messages, both for the general public and for partners/stakeholders who may wish to talk about FBS on their own sites using the correct messaging.

Work in progress...
