## Details
### 1. SEP - Accessibility - [Cookie notice continue button, context extension](https://scotent.leankit.com/card/829611697)
https://se-qa-singleentrypoint.azurewebsites.net/

Clear your cookies before loading the above link.
The cookie banner that appears has a continue CTA.   Visually this makes sense, as the user can see it's linked to the cookie notice, however for assitive tech, specifically braille/screen readers who can't visually digest the layout association with the cookie notice, it might not be clear from the text "Continue" what this link will do.
We can simply add a accessible span, which will extend the text of the link to assitive techs only (not visually)

e.g. `<span class="sr-only"> and close cookie notice </span>`

### 2. SEP - Accessibility - [Users were unsure what fields were mandatory](https://scotent.leankit.com/card/831026973)

### 4. SEP - Accessibility - [Desktop mobile menu is being fed back to assitive tech on desktop mode](https://scotent.leankit.com/card/829592114)
Go to: https://se-qa-singleentrypoint.azurewebsites.net/browse-support

On desktop, there is an sr-only span with the inner HTML text of "Open mobile navigation menu".  This should only be visible to assitive techs on mobile mode.   Please add aria-hidden="true" is you are not in mobile mode.
