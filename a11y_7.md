## Details
### 1. SEP - accessibility - [static pages have no h1](https://scotent.leankit.com/card/838723706)
Static pages on findbusinesssupport.gov.scot have no level 1 heading.

- <https://se-qa-singleentrypoint.azurewebsites.net/privacy-policy/>
- <https://se-qa-singleentrypoint.azurewebsites.net/cookie-policy/>
- <https://se-qa-singleentrypoint.azurewebsites.net/terms-and-conditions/>
- <https://se-qa-singleentrypoint.azurewebsites.net/accessibility/>

What should be the h1 is marked up as h2. For example:

`<h2 class="title-block__title">Privacy policy</h2>`

** Card: https://scotent.leankit.com/card/838723706 **
#### Notes: All pages now have a relevant H1 heading :-)

### 2. GDL (affecting SE/SDI/BREXIT/SEP) - [skip/accessibility links truncated on Firefox.](https://scotent.leankit.com/card/835687002)
Source of an issue is in GDL (tested on <https://se-qa-globaldesignlanguage.azurewebsites.net/test_package>)

From some reason when accessing skip links on Firefox they appear truncated, see video for details on SE website as an example:

 **https://www.screencast.com/t/pMcUjYZiy**

#### Notes: Open in Firefox and tab through links **

### 3. GDL/SEP - Accessibility -  [Add jump link for postcode field on enquiry form.](https://scotent.leankit.com/card/836251864)
1. Go to <https://www.findbusinesssupport.gov.scot/contact-us/>

2. Enter company's name.

3. Click 'Submit' button.

Actual:  List of validation jump links at the appearing at the top of the form is missing a link for postcode field.

#### Note: Company postcode validation link now included in the warning messages at the top of the page upon clicking the submit button.

** Card: https://scotent.leankit.com/card/836251864**
#### Notes: Open form and fail an address lookup before submitting. The PostCode jumplink is now there **

### 4. SEP - Accessibility - [Desktop support type listbox does not feedback selected state](https://scotent.leankit.com/card/829593235**)

Go to: <https://se-qa-singleentrypoint.azurewebsites.net/browse-support>

On desktop open the Type of Support listbox

State changes are not fed back to assitive tech when a user selects, or deselect a listbox option.  You can use aria-selected for this.

W3 has a good example of an accessible multi select listbox: <https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/WD-wai-aria-practices-1.1-20170628/examples/listbox/listbox.html#ex2_label>


#### Notes:f12/Inspect and demo

- `Each option (<button> elements in the markup) is marked with an aria-selected state`
  - `"false" by default (no selection made)`
  - `"true" when selected`
  - `"false" when deselected`
- `The parent container (<menu id="pseudo-select-supportTypeIds">) aria-activedescendant attributed is updated to match the option is selected`

#### Notes: f12 and Inspect. Demo state change **

### 5. GDL / SEP - Accessibility - [Forms improvements](https://scotent.leankit.com/card/836220546)
<https://www.findbusinesssupport.gov.scot/contact-us/>

Enter nothing and hit submit.   You'll see we've a nice accessible form implementation developed.   However a couple of tweaks are still required:

- Make the jump link <strong> tag ```"**Submission errors that need resolved" a header (H2)**```
- Input fields should have an ```aria-describedby``` attribute that maps to it's equivalent validation error.
- Validation containers should have unique ID's.
- All mandatory fields should have ```aria-required``` implemented on them
- On submission, set focus to the header on the success / failure page that's returned.

## 6. SEP - Accessibility - Mobile support type listbox is not accessible
Go to: https://se-qa-singleentrypoint.azurewebsites.net/browse-support

On mobile, click the "Filters" CTA button

The listbox for support type is not an accessible implementation

The fact the listbox has multi select capability is not fed back to the user
There is no native way other than shift down/up arrow to multi select items using the keyboard.   

Shift up/down arrow is not a native accessible method.   User should be able to be notified when they've selected individual items using the space key (not enter key), that their state has toggled from not selected, to selected.   

Shift up/down method can stay, as it's a good addition, but likewise it needs to notify the state changes have occurred.  This might be complicated, so feel free to remove shift select capabilities in favour of simplicity


There is no indication that you can select more than one option.
W3 has a good example of an accessible multi select listbox: https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/WD-wai-aria-practices-1.1-20170628/examples/listbox/listbox.html#ex2_label

## 8. SEP - Wrong closing tag on results-listing__title causing validation errors
