# Quick Redesign January 2021


## Context

### Urgent need to help businesses to more effectively navigate the funding landscape
- Increasingly busy and more complex as new support and help becomes available
- Customers not getting to the ‘browse support’ page and getting lost on ‘coronavirus advice’
- It's appearing from multiple partners with confusing user journeys, for niche sectors and with conflicting eligibility
- Customers ‘hedging their bets’ on the best support for them
- High levels of anxiety


### Improve the ‘end to end’ comms process  
- Link ScotGov funding announcements with information on FBS
- Funds being announced via blogs
- Teams not knowing when announcements are being made
- No line of site of what's coming next


We received lots of feedback about the site itself from a lot of stakeholders.
Our aim is to help more businesses identify and access the funding they need, and reduce confusion about where to go for information.

## FBS is part of a wider system, which is not working optimally

## The approach we took
- Undertaken a two-week intensive rapid improvement programme Coronavirus pages
- Use research, user behaviour and analytics need to underpin the changes we want to make
- Continue to iterate quickly
- Try and make changes that don’t require development, unless absolutely necessary

## Analysis and research
Understanding user behaviour and preferences to help prioritise the actions to take

## Next steps

### FBS site
- Ongoing engagement with users and business organisations, as well as using the analytics & insights - to inform further iterative change as and when needed

### Wider funding landscape and environment

- Work by Scottish Government is underway on simplifying and streamlining the funding landscape. FBS team can assist with user insight & analytics
- Using existing Business Support Partnership channels, focus on the ‘end to end’ communication processes – to link announcements with partners so channels and content are aligned & ready
- Further work needed to increase awareness of FBS and email updates, particularly amongst intermediary organisations
- Ongoing sharing of user analytics and intelligence with public sector partners so that there is a more consistent user experience beyond FBS
